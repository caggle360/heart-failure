This script summarizes variables from a dataset from kaggle on heart failure. More information about the dataset can be found at this website https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.

```{r, setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(gt)
library(dplyr)

source("../functions/good_round.R")
```

```{r, importData}

# Load CSV into R Session
data <- read.csv("../Clean_Data/cleaned_data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Convert binary variables to factors so we can summarize each variable correctly
colsToFactor <- c("heart_failure", "sex", "smoker", "diabetic", "high_BP", "anemic")
data[colsToFactor] <- lapply(data[colsToFactor], factor)
```

There are `r nrow(data)` observations and `r ncol(data)` columns in this dataset.
The first 6 rows of the dataset can be observed below

$~$

```{r, rows}
data_sub <- head(data)

gt_first6 <-
  gt(data_sub) %>%
    tab_header(title = "First 6 Rows of Heart Failure Data")

# Print first six rows of data  
gt_first6
```

The following table prints the mean for each continuous variable in our dataset by heart failure status.

The following table prints summary statistics for each discrete variable in our dataset. We can see that the groups are fairly similar in the percentages of subjects who have a certain characteristic in a group. A higher percentage of subjects in the group that experienced heart failure had high blood pressure and were anemic.

Let's look at a boxplot of age stratified by heart failure status.
